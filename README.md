# Political gerrymandering in Ohio
Course project for EN 553.732 Bayesian Statistics. We look at politicial gerrymandering of election results in the state of Ohio from a Bayesian perspective.

## Data
To use the code, you first need to download the data from [this link](https://github.com/mggg/ohio-precincts/blob/153bb5968bc4a2bd15d97daec85d748b5cbbee61/shp.zip). Note that this is the original version of the shapefile. The code is not compatible with the new updated version, since the new version has different fields.

## How to run the code
The code can be run end-to-end by running the script `gerry.R`. It performs MH sampling, creates redistricting maps, and saves them, along with results.

## Questions
For any questions about the code, contact me at `tabrish1@jhu.edu`.
